# Shooting-Aircraft-Simulation-in-Space-using-OpenGL-with-Mid-Point-Line-and-Circle-Drawing-Algorithm
In this project, I tried to make a preview of a shooting game where an aircraft will shoot some bullets at asteroids and after getting hit by the bullets asteroids will be destroyed. Also, if the aircraft gets in contact with any of the asteroids, then the rocket will also be destroyed. To implement this idea, I use transformation such as translation and scaling to optimize the code. Moreover, I use a Midpoint Line Drawing and Circle Drawing Algorithm to draw all the objects.
